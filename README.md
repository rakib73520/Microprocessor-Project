The UIU Lost and Found System aims to provide a comprehensive and automated solution for managing lost items within the university campus.

The system employs machine learning techniques for object detection and classification, utilizing a webcam to analyze and store the characteristics of found items. The project utilizes RFID scanners for user identification, IR sensors for item transfer, and a conveyor belt system for item movement. The user interacts with the system using a keypad and an LCD display to claim their lost item.
